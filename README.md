# üåç Earth From Space: NASA EPIC Imagery

## This is a simple web application that displays the latest images of Earth captured by NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the DSCOVR satellite. 

Users can select a specific date and view a beautiful, high-resolution image of our planet, along with detailed metadata about the satellite's position.


### üöÄ Features

* Daily Imagery: Automatically fetches and displays the most recent Earth image from the NASA EPIC API.
* Date Selection: Allows users to choose a specific date to view historical images.
* Detailed Metadata: Shows important contextual information for each image, including:
* Image filename and capture date
* Geographical centroid coordinates
* The positions of the DSCOVR satellite

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

* HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.
* CSS3: For styling, including the dark theme and responsive layout.
* JavaScript (ES6+): For fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the page content.
* NASA EPIC API: The data source for the daily Earth imagery and metadata.
